# ncaam-predictions
Contains a number of different scripts for predicting the results of NCAA Men's Basketball Games. Training data is largely taken from provided Kaggle 2024 Machine Learning Mania Data. This competition can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/march-machine-learning-mania-2024/overview). This project currently contains only individual scripts with individual models. Eventually, it will also contain a site where a user can see predictions for future games, visualize team strenghts, and interact with the models and data in other ways. 

# Scripts
This folder contains individual models in **/scripts/models** and experimental notebooks and results in **/scripts/experiments**. Each of these scripts can be viewed independently.
