I choose conference mean, rather than overall mean, to account for certain conferences being consistently stronger than others. With ~30 games in the regular season, each team should approach their true elo rating regardless of how ratings are reverted to the mean. However, because the vast majority of nonconference games appear early in the season, sub-optimal reversion will make it more difficult for conferences to approach their true strenghts.
